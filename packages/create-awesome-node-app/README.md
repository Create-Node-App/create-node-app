The primary goal of this project is to provide a stable foundation upon which to build modern web applications. Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete real-world application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make front-end development robust and easy.

## Quickstart

```sh
npx create-awesome-node-app my-project # or specify flag `-h` to see all options
cd my-project
npm start
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

## Creating an app

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node 18 or later on your local development machine**. You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

It will create a directory called `my-project` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-awesome-node-app my-project
```
